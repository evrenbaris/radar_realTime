# Real-Time Radar Signal Simulation

This project simulates radar signals in real-time, adding noise and detecting targets dynamically.

## Features
- Generates radar signals in real-time.
- Adds dynamic noise for realistic simulation.
- Detects and visualizes targets exceeding a defined threshold.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Matplotlib**
- **NumPy**

## How to Run
1. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib
